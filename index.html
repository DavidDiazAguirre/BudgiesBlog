    <h2>Welcome to the homepage of my beloved birds!</h2>
    <p>I've got two budgies, Kiwi and Sky. You can guess which is which from the color!</p>

        </span>
    <p>They sure like resting on one leg. I guess it's not just a flamingo thing.</p>
    <p>Sometimes they get along like peanut butter and jam...</p>

        </span>    
    <p>And sometimes they get a LITTLE too close...</p>

    <p>Here's a list of some of their favorite things.</p>

    <div class="container">
    <ul>
        <li>Oat Spray (this gets their attention STAT)</li>
        <li>Vegetables (bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers)</li>
        <li>Spray millet (it's like popcorn to them, before you know it they've eaten the whole thing!)</li>
        <li>Toys! A fun, stimulating environment inside and outside their cage is very important to their wellbeing.</li>
    </ul>    
    </div>

    <figcaption>They go nuts for oat spray! Sky is probably distracted with some pigeon outside...</figcaption>

    <img height=450px src="budgies_home4bellpeper.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>They love eating the bell pepper bit by bit, and they love tossing the seeds around even more!</figcaption>
