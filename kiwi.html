    <h2>Just look at this distinguished gentleman...</h2>

    <p>On the homepage I ask you to choose a favorite between Sky and Kiwi... and to be honest, I'd choose Kiwi.</p>
    <p>He's just so calm and peaceful and loves playing but also minds his own business! Unlike his blue partner.</p>
    <img height=450px src="kiwi_eating1.jpg" alt="A green budgie eating from his owner's hand">
    <p>He eats from my hand so kindly, unlike Sky who has to give the hand a few mean bites first to make sure it isn't some evil snake!</p>

    <p>Did you know male budgies tend to be the calmer, gentler ones of the two sexes?</p>
    <p>It's difficult to keep two female budgies together, but two males will get along great! <br>
        This is because females are the more dominant of the two sexes in this type of bird. They're not great at sharing. <br>
        A male and a female, well, they have their ups and downs like any relationship...</p>
    <p>Here are a few things Kiwi likes and... could do without:</p>
