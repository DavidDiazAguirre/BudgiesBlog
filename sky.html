    <p>Now, hear me out, I might like Kiwi better but that does not mean I hate this lady!</p>
    <p>Her personality is a bit... rough around the edges, but she still loves to play.</p>

    <p>She loves to look around and explore! Just, not where there are others nearby. <br> You get close, she bites!</p>
